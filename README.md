## About
This is a real-time chat app that allows users to sign in with their Google account and post messages.  Messages are limited to 140 characters.  The message area can be sorted using the sort buttons, or can be filtered to show only a certain users messages by clicking on their name.  Messages cannot be submitted until a user logs in but they can be read.  The front end is built in React and we are using Firebase for the back-end and for authentication.
